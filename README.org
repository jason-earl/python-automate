** Challenge 1
   
   Learn to setup a python environment.  Write a unittest.

** Challenge 2

   Learn to write basic unit tests using Selenium.  Learning to wait
   is key.

** Challenge 3

   This challenge is not currently set up as a unittest.  It does use
   the requisite for loop.  I probably shouldn't get so far ahead.  It
   becomes clearer what is required after you go to the class.

** Challenge 4

   Fibonacci sequences and an int to English translator.  Complete
   with 66 tests.

** Challenge 5

   I think I was supposed to learn about if statements.  I mostly
   learned about defaultdict.
